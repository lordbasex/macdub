  caveats <<~EOS
    MacDub needs Screen & System Audio Recording and Speech Recognition permissions
    (System Settings › Privacy & Security). Grant them, then relaunch the app.

    MCP server for Claude Code / Claude Desktop / Codex (open MacDub once first, or use the
    "Add to Claude Code" button inside the app):
      claude mcp add --scope user macdub "$HOME/Library/Application Support/MacDub/bin/macdub-mcp"
